# Battleship Project

## Overview

This project brings the classic game of Battleship to life through the use of computer networking principles such as socket programming, enabling server-client communication. The game is coded in Java, leveraging the power of data structures and object-oriented programming.

## Features

1. **Ship Placement:** Users can strategically place their ships on the game board, adding a layer of tactical decision-making to the gameplay.

2. **Multiplayer Experience:** Players are paired together to engage in thrilling battles against each other, creating a dynamic and competitive gaming environment.

3. **Targeted Strikes:** Users have the ability to target specific squares on the game board, adding a strategic element to their offensive maneuvers.

4. **Real-time Notifications:** Receive instant notifications on the outcome of your shots, whether it's a hit, a miss, or the satisfying moment when you sink an opponent's ship.

5. **Game Outcome Detection:** The server actively detects and announces when a game is won or lost, providing closure and feedback to the players.

6. **Concurrent Games:** With support for any number of games in progress simultaneously, players can engage in multiple battles, keeping the action flowing.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the server script to initiate the Battleship server.
4. Run the client script to connect.
5. Have someone else also run the client script. (must be on the same host)
6. Place your ships strategically and start the game!
